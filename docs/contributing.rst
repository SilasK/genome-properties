Contributing to Genome Properties
=================================

The majority of the initial set of Genome Properties were produced within the TIGRFAM project, and refer to predominantly prokaryotic genomes. In parallel with the integration of Genome Properties into InterPro, further (predominantly eukaryotic) properties were produced by the InterPro group, and have been added to the total set. We welcome collaboration with any groups with an interest in defining further Genome Properties based on their own area of interest/expertise.
